      <h4>The “alfajores”</h4>
      <p>Although they are a traditional Andalusian sweet, they arrived in
        Argentina at the time of the colony to become a typical and traditional
        dish.
        These are two round cookies made with wheat flour and
        butter, joined by an exquisite dulce de leche.</p>
