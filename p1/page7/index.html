      <h4>Share Mate, a sacred ritual</h4>
      <p>Every Argentine in any part of the world carries his Mate, his grass
        and his thermos. This drink is
        indispensable
        in the lives of Argentines.
        However, what makes this one of the most unique Argentine
        customs is the way in which Mate is taken. Although you could take it
        alone, the common thing is that Mate is shared among friends.
        Therefore, it is very common to see a group of friends sitting sharing
        the drink with the same bulb and passing the Mate from hand to
        hand.</p>
