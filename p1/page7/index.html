    <h4>SHARE MATE, A SACRED RITUAL</h4>
    <div class="circle"></div>
    <div id="sname">
      <p>Every Argentine in any part of the world carries his Mate, his grass and his thermos. This drink is <a href="../page8/index.html">indispensable</a> in the lives of Argentines. However, what makes this one of the most unique Argentine customs is the way in which Mate is taken. Although you could take it alone, the common thing is that Mate is shared among friends. Therefore, it is very common to see a group of friends sitting sharing the drink with the same bulb and passing the Mate from hand to hand.</p>
