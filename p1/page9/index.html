    <h4>DINNER ALMOST MIDNIGHT</h4>
    <div class="circle"></div>
    <div class="hover">
      <p>The life of an Argentine person is quite hectic. Between sharing time with friends, enjoying food and living the long nightlife in the cities, the day gets longer. That is why Argentines have a <a href="../page10/index.html">habit</a> of having dinner quite late. So, prepare a snack for mid-afternoon, because you will have dinner after 9 pm, at the earliest.</p>
